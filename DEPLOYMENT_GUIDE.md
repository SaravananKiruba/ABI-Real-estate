# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your project is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` with base URL for GitHub Pages
2. ✅ Added deployment scripts to `package.json`
3. ✅ Installed `gh-pages` package
4. ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your site when you push to the `main` branch.

**Steps:**
1. Commit and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to: https://github.com/SaravananKiruba/ABI-Real-estate/settings/pages
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Click Save

3. Your site will be automatically deployed to:
   **https://saravanankiruba.github.io/ABI-Real-estate/**

---

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

Deploy manually using the npm script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
1. Build your project (`npm run build`)
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch

**Note:** For manual deployment, you need to set GitHub Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" and select the `gh-pages` branch in your repository settings.

---

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Base URL**: The vite config is set to `/ABI-Real-estate/` to match your repository name
2. **Branch**: Make sure you're pushing to the `main` branch for automatic deployment
3. **Build Output**: The build outputs to the `dist` folder
4. **First Deployment**: The first deployment may take a few minutes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the base URL in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
- Check the Actions tab for deployment status

### If assets don't load:
- Make sure all imports use relative paths
- Verify the base URL is correctly set

---

## 🌐 Your Deployment URL

After deployment, your site will be available at:
**https://saravanankiruba.github.io/ABI-Real-estate/**

---

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push your changes
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Wait for the deployment to complete
4. Visit your site!

Happy deploying! 🎉
